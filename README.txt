I would like to implement a forum app.
It will support topics and comments. Each user will be able to comment, but just some will be able to create topics. Every time someone replies in a topic, the owner of the topic gets notified. Every user must login to browse and post comments. Users also have their pofile pages where they can add public details about themselves. Comments will hava an option that will allow any users but the owner to rate them as useful or not. The user profile will have charts and ratings for user utility of his comments. The app will have multiple views like topic, comment, user profile. Every action performed by the user will be checked if correct and the user is sure about it with a dialog box.
